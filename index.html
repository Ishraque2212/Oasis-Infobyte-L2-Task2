                            <hr>
                            M.S. Dhoni, also known as "Mahi," is a former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian
                            national team. He was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Bihar, India. Dhoni is widely
                            regarded as one of the greatest cricket captains of all time, and his contribution to Indian
                            cricket has been immense. In this tribute webpage, we will delve into the life and
                            achievements of M.S. Dhoni.

                            <h2>Early Life</h2><hr>
                            Dhoni's father, Pan Singh, worked for MECON, a public sector company. Dhoni's interest in
                            cricket was apparent from an early age. He played for various local clubs and eventually
                            caught
                            the attention of Deval Sahay, a former Ranchi cricket team captain. Sahay recognized Dhoni's
                            talent and encouraged him to pursue cricket more seriously.

                            <h2>Career</h2><hr>
                            Dhoni made his debut for the Indian cricket team in December 2004 in a One Day International
                            (ODI) match against Bangladesh. He quickly became known for his aggressive and unorthodox
                            style
                            of play, which often left his opponents bewildered. <br><br>

                            Dhoni's most significant contribution to Indian cricket was as the captain of the national
                            team.
                            He took over the captaincy in 2007 and led the team to victory in the 2007 ICC World
                            Twenty20,
                            the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, and the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. Under his captaincy, the
                            Indian
                            cricket team also achieved the number one ranking in test cricket for the first time. <br><br>

                            Dhoni's leadership and decision-making skills were highly praised by cricket experts and
                            fans
                            alike. He was known for his calm demeanor and his ability to keep his cool even in the most
                            high-pressure situations.

                            Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket in August 2020, bringing an end to
                            an
                            illustrious career that spanned 16 years. He left behind a legacy of success and
                            achievements
                            that will be hard to match.

                                M.S. Dhoni will always be remembered as one of the greatest cricketers and captains in
                                the
                                history of Indian cricket. His contribution to the sport and his leadership skills have
                                left
                                an indelible mark on the game. As we pay tribute to him, we can only hope that his
                                legacy
                                will continue to inspire the next generation of cricketers in India and around the
                                world. <br>

                        country. He places his country and parents above everything else in his life, including his
                        wife. This statement indicates his deep respect and commitment towards his country and its
                        values, which he holds very close to his heart. It also shows how he prioritizes his
                        responsibilities towards his family and his nation.
